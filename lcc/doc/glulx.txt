BUGS:
 - division/remainder operations operate on signed integers only
 - no support for struct parameters/return values/locals yet? (need to check)

Label scoping problems:
 - static functions are not local to function scope when using glulxcc driver
 - label_name() still doesn't work correctly if static functions with the same
   name occur in more than one compilation unit.
